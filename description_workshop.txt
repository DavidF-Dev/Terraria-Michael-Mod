[h1]Foreword[/h1]
In honour of Michael (aka 'Michaelsoftman'), a beloved member of the tModLoader community.
Many of us have been touched by Michael's words & actions in one way or another over the years.
From humble beginnings, Michael joined the tModLoader Discord at the young age of 4, seeking to build impactful mods and unique experiences for players to enjoy. 
Over the span of 20 years, Michael not only achieved his goal, but also became a pillar of the community, inspiring others to create, learn, and improve.
He will be missed by many, but especially by me. Michael, my dearest, Michael... why won't you return my calls?
